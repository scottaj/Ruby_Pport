== Pport

README
------------------

Description

This is a ruby library for interfacing with a parallel port. It currently
supports windows via the inpout32.dll library and linux via the /dev/port file.
More platforms may be added in the future(or current platforms refined)
if it is requested or someone else is motivated enough to do the work.
--------------------------------------------

Installation is done via the gem command:

1) run the command: #gem install Pport

2)  - Windows Requirements -

        * To use the on microsoft windows you must have a copy of the inpout32
          library availible on your system. You can find the DLL at:
          http://logix4u.net/Legacy_Ports/Parallel_Port/Inpout32.dll_for_Windows_98/2000/NT/XP.html

    - Linux Requirements -

        * On linux you must run any program using this library as root or
        another user who has read and write permissions to /dev/port.
        !Please note, giving users read and write permissions to /dev/port can
        be a serious security risk and should be done with caution!
